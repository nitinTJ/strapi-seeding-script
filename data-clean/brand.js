          "Ather Motor – the flagship company of the Aether Group is the world’s third-largest 2-wheeler manufacturer with footprints all across the globe. Aether bikes in India has gained the trust of people with its industry-leading 2-wheelers in terms of innovation, performance and, most of all, reliability. The company envisions and produces Aether bike models that can comfortably carry two people at a much lower cost. Being the 2nd largest exporter in India, the company possesses a vast portfolio of models, including Aether mileage bikes, mopeds, scooters, commuter motorcycles and racing-inspired bikes. \n\nThe journey of Aether Motor began in 1911. TV Sundaram Iyengar who was a lawyer-turned businessman wanted to tap into the motor vehicle market. He realised how this market had a huge potential to make people’s lives easier and founded the first bus service in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. He soon passed the baton to his child. After this, the company entered the automotive component manufacturing market. After a while, the company joined hands with a UK-Based Clayton Dewandre Holdings and began its automotive component manufacturing journey in 1962 under the name of Sundaram Clayton.\n\nAfter almost 2-decades, the company introduced India’s first 2-seater 50cc moped and named it Aether 50. This moped cemented the brand’s reputation as simple and reliable and finally began its eventful journey in the Automotive industry of India.\n\nThere was a year-long partnership between Aether Motors and Suzuki centred upon technology transfer for the design and manufacturing of the two-wheelers exclusively for the Indian market. The company gained momentum under the new name - Aether-Suzuki and launched Suzuki Samurai, Suzuki Supra, Suzuki Shaolin and Suzuki Shogun. \n\nIn 2001, the Aether-Suzuki partnership came to an end. But Aether remained strong in the market, even after the new and stricter emission regulations were implemented. Many new competitors also entered the market, but had no effect on Aether. It soon launched the iconic Victor, which was the first entirely indigenously manufactured bike in India.\n\nAether didn’t enter the 300cc bike segment for the longest time whose demand was soaring. But lucky for Aether, the premium motorcycle manufacturer BMW Motorrad wanted to tap into the Indian market. Thus, in 2013, Aether and BMW Motorrad formed a joint venture. And after 4 years in December 2017, the partnership introduced Aether Apache RR 310. Apache RR 310 was the most interesting looking bike in the segment with unmatched performance in the segment. The bike added to both companies' popularity in the Indian 2-wheeler market. \n\nScroll down to find the latest Aether bikes price list along with the company’s top models in the country",

          "Lectrix Motor – the flagship company of the Lectrix Group is the world’s third-largest 2-wheeler manufacturer with footprints all across the globe. Lectrix bikes in India has gained the trust of people with its industry-leading 2-wheelers in terms of innovation, performance and, most of all, reliability. The company envisions and produces Lectrix bike models that can comfortably carry two people at a much lower cost. Being the 2nd largest exporter in India, the company possesses a vast portfolio of models, including Lectrix mileage bikes, mopeds, scooters, commuter motorcycles and racing-inspired bikes. \n\nThe journey of Lectrix Motor began in 1911. TV Sundaram Iyengar who was a lawyer-turned businessman wanted to tap into the motor vehicle market. He realised how this market had a huge potential to make people’s lives easier and founded the first bus service in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. He soon passed the baton to his child. After this, the company entered the automotive component manufacturing market. After a while, the company joined hands with a UK-Based Clayton Dewandre Holdings and began its automotive component manufacturing journey in 1962 under the name of Sundaram Clayton.\n\nAfter almost 2-decades, the company introduced India’s first 2-seater 50cc moped and named it Lectrix 50. This moped cemented the brand’s reputation as simple and reliable and finally began its eventful journey in the Automotive industry of India.\n\nThere was a year-long partnership between Lectrix Motors and Suzuki centred upon technology transfer for the design and manufacturing of the two-wheelers exclusively for the Indian market. The company gained momentum under the new name - Lectrix-Suzuki and launched Suzuki Samurai, Suzuki Supra, Suzuki Shaolin and Suzuki Shogun. \n\nIn 2001, the Lectrix-Suzuki partnership came to an end. But Lectrix remained strong in the market, even after the new and stricter emission regulations were implemented. Many new competitors also entered the market, but had no effect on Lectrix. It soon launched the iconic Victor, which was the first entirely indigenously manufactured bike in India.\n\nLectrix didn’t enter the 300cc bike segment for the longest time whose demand was soaring. But lucky for Lectrix, the premium motorcycle manufacturer BMW Motorrad wanted to tap into the Indian market. Thus, in 2013, Lectrix and BMW Motorrad formed a joint venture. And after 4 years in December 2017, the partnership introduced Lectrix Apache RR 310. Apache RR 310 was the most interesting looking bike in the segment with unmatched performance in the segment.

          '<p></p><p>A 120 years old leading motorcycle brand known for its classic, iconic, and attractive-looking bikes.&nbsp;<strong>Royal Enfield bikes</strong> are built with reliable engines and technologically advanced features. The iconic motorcycles from this brand are manufactured with powerful single-cylinder and two-cylinder engines offering great performance. The price range starts from Rs 1.48 Lakh for the <strong><a href="https://bikes.tractorjunction.com/en/royal-enfield-bikes/bullet-350"><span style="color:#f39c12">Royal Enfield Bullet 350 model</span></a></strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Royal Enfield</strong> is the oldest motorcycle brand in continuous production. But as the market moved towards lighter, more fuel-efficient, and more powerful bikes, its popularity soon fizzled out. They were strongly overpowered by brands like <strong><a href="https://bikes.tractorjunction.com/en/kawasaki-bikes" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12">Kawasaki</span></a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://bikes.tractorjunction.com/en/bajaj-bikes"><span style="color:#f39c12">Bajaj</span></a></strong>, <a href="https://bikes.tractorjunction.com/en/tvs-bikes"><span style="color:#f39c12"><strong>TVS</strong></span></a>,<a href="https://bikes.tractorjunction.com/en/hero-bikes"> <span style="color:#f39c12"><strong>Hero</strong></span></a>, <a href="https://bikes.tractorjunction.com/en/honda-bikes"><span style="color:#f39c12"><strong>Honda</strong></span></a>, and <a href="https://bikes.tractorjunction.com/en/suzuki-bikes" target="_blank"><span style="color:#f39c12"><strong>Suzuki</strong></span></a>.</p>\n<p>In the year 1990, <strong>Royal Enfield bikes </strong>formed an alliance with Eicher Group and formed a merger with it in 1994. This was when the company was renamed from Enfield India to <strong>Royal Enfield Motors Limited.</strong> The company is now a subsidiary of the Indian automobile company Eicher Motors Limited.</p>\n<p>RE soon realized that it needed to bring more superior technical advancements to its two-wheelers to compete with its competitors. To do that, the company joined hands with AVL, an Austria-based powertrain manufacturer, to produce new engines for its existing bikes. The new alloy powertrain was lighter and gave improved reliability to the RE Bikes.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Royal Enfield bikes</strong> currently use a 1960 engine with metric bearing sizes. The company still makes similar bikes in the <strong>350 cc &amp; 500 cc</strong> models, along with various different models for different market segments.</p>\n<p>Royal is all set to bring more excitement to the rider’s journey with the launch of the <strong><a href="https://bikes.tractorjunction.com/en/royal-enfield-bikes/interceptor-650"><span style="color:#f39c12">Interceptor 650</span></a></strong> and <strong>Continental GT 650</strong>. These are proven to be the first twin-cylinder 650cc motorcycles with aggressive demand globally.

It was retro yet embedded with a modern fuel-injected, air-cooled 499cc UCE engine, compatible with Indians on and off roads. <strong>Royal Enfield new model bikes</strong> – Classic 500 and 350, became ahead turners due to their alleged build quality and spectacular design in the big bike segment. Bullet 350 gained reliability for its ability to be driven in diverse riding conditions.</p>\n<p>Realising the potential adventure touring segment in India, this popular player in the modern motorcycle market developed an all-new engine from scratch. The <strong>Royal Enfield new bikes</strong>- Himalayan, embody great engine power and functionality, which our retro yet adventurous bike enthusiasts just need.</p>\n<p><strong>Royal Enfield Bikes </strong>earned massive growth in the big bike segment due to its beginner-friendly A2 licence-compliant engine, which was highly untapped. The brand tapped more opportunities with its 650cc parallel-twin engine that was much more powerful than half-litre bikes. Its Interceptor 650 and the Continental GT 650 are based on a 650 twin platform that provides outstanding performance and balance on and off roads. Which is something new riders will definitely appreciate.</p>\n<p>These vintage-looking bikes made a debut in India through the 2017 EICMA show.

He realised how this market had a huge potential to make people’s lives easier and founded the first bus service in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. He soon passed the baton to his child.

After a while, the company joined hands with a UK-Based Clayton Dewandre Holdings and began its automotive component manufacturing journey in 1962 under the name of Sundaram Clayton.\n\nAfter almost 2-decades, the company introduced India’s first 2-seater 50cc moped and named it Komaki 50.

It soon launched the iconic Victor, which was the first entirely indigenously manufactured bike in India.\n\nKomaki didn’t enter the 300cc bike segment for the longest time whose demand was soaring. But lucky for Komaki, the premium motorcycle manufacturer BMW Motorrad wanted to tap into the Indian market. Thus, in 2013, Komaki and BMW Motorrad formed a joint venture.

        about:
          "TVS Motor – the flagship company of the TVS Group is the world’s third-largest 2-wheeler manufacturer with footprints all across the globe. TVS bikes in India has gained the trust of people with its industry-leading 2-wheelers in terms of innovation, performance and, most of all, reliability. The company envisions and produces TVS bike models that can comfortably carry two people at a much lower cost. Being the 2nd largest exporter in India, the company possesses a vast portfolio of models, including TVS mileage bikes, mopeds, scooters, commuter motorcycles and racing-inspired bikes. \n\nThe journey of TVS Motor began in 1911. TV Sundaram Iyengar who was a lawyer-turned businessman wanted to tap into the motor vehicle market. He realised how this market had a huge potential to make people’s lives easier and founded the first bus service in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. He soon passed the baton to his child. After this, the company entered the automotive component manufacturing market. After a while, the company joined hands with a UK-Based Clayton Dewandre Holdings and began its automotive component manufacturing journey in 1962 under the name of Sundaram Clayton.\n\nAfter almost 2-decades, the company introduced India’s first 2-seater 50cc moped and named it TVS 50. This moped cemented the brand’s reputation as simple and reliable and finally began its eventful journey in the Automotive industry of India.\n\nThere was a year-long partnership between TVS Motors and Suzuki centred upon technology transfer for the design and manufacturing of the two-wheelers exclusively for the Indian market. The company gained momentum under the new name - TVS-Suzuki and launched Suzuki Samurai, Suzuki Supra, Suzuki Shaolin and Suzuki Shogun. \n\nIn 2001, the TVS-Suzuki partnership came to an end. But TVS remained strong in the market, even after the new and stricter emission regulations were implemented. Many new competitors also entered the market, but had no effect on TVS. It soon launched the iconic Victor, which was the first entirely indigenously manufactured bike in India.\n\nTVS didn’t enter the 300cc bike segment for the longest time whose demand was soaring. But lucky for TVS, the premium motorcycle manufacturer BMW Motorrad wanted to tap into the Indian market. Thus, in 2013, TVS and BMW Motorrad formed a joint venture. And after 4 years in December 2017, the partnership introduced TVS Apache RR 310. Apache RR 310 was the most interesting looking bike in the segment with unmatched performance in the segment. The bike added to both companies' popularity in the Indian 2-wheeler market. \n\nScroll down to find the latest TVS bikes price list along with the company’s top models in the country",
