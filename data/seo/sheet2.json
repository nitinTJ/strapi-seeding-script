    "Content(Body)": "Find Single Disc Brake Bikes \nThe single disc braking system, which was first manufactured exclusively for mountain bikes, has now become the new standard. Nowadays, the majority of vehicles have disc brakes. They are attached to the vehicle's front or back side. A disc brake employs a calliper equipped with brake pads to grasp a rotating disc or rotor in order to stop a wheel (and your bike). \n\nThe effectiveness of disc brakes in motorcycles is significantly influenced by the size of the disc/rotor. 240-300 mm front discs are the most common size on bikes in India. This Buell XB12SX Lightning City X, which used 375 mm front disc brakes, is one example of a big rotor. \n\nThe disc, calliper, and brake pads make up the disc brake kit for motorcycles. The disc or rotor is mounted on the outside of the wheel and has brake pads on either side in the basic design of a bicycle or scooter's disc brake system. The viscous fluid that connects the entire system is referred to as brake oil, and it is connected via a thick fluid line. The oil reservoir, which is linked to the pump and the brake lever, is where the brake oil is obtained. \n\nBikes equipped with single-disc brakes are popularly known as single-disc variants. However, bikes manufactured with disc and drum brakes on the front and rear wheels are known as single-disc motorcycles. Single Disc brake in motorcycles, as the name suggests, single-disc braking is used on one wheel of a bike. \n\nHow disc brake works in motorcycles- \n\nThe disc brake motorcycle system effectively stops the vehicle by employing hydraulic pressure by converting the speed of the bike into heat. Brake pads are attached to the callipers that are in contact with the discs. When the brake pedal is pressed, the braking fluid is forced to move, which puts hydraulic pressure on the brake pads. The pressure causes the brake pads to squeeze the braking disc. Because of the friction created between the disc and the pad, your bike slows down. \n\nSingle disc brakes are typically made of cast iron. High-performance vehicles use rotors made of composite materials like vehicles on fibre or ceramic. Due to the directional vanes they contain, some of the rotors can only be mounted on one side of the vehicle. \n\nWhy do you need to opt for bikes with Single Disc Brakes? \n\nPowerful Gripping Ability \n\nThe stopping and gripping power of disc brakes are superior to that of traditional drum brakes. They can increase friction in the disc and reduce wheel movement. \n\nMore Effective in Adverse Weather \n\nDisc brakes are effective in adverse weather. If wet, they may dry quickly and easily. Even during the rainy season, brakes maintain their gripping force. \n\nSimple to Clean \n\nDrum brakes require more maintenance than disc brakes. The mechanic has to open the drum brake fully. On the other hand, it is simple to clean the disc. \n\nNo Heating Up \n\nThey require little hand pressing and are simple to control. Drivers must apply intense pressure to drum brakes in order to stop their motorcycles. Due to being open, disc brakes do not heat up. In the event that they heat up, they cool down within a few seconds. \n\nDifferent from other brakes, no rim damage \n\nThe absence of wheel damage is another benefit of disc brakes. For instance, rim brakes create a rough surface when applied repeatedly. No such problem will be faced with the first disc. \n\nPopular Models in India that are equipped with Single Disc Braking system: \n\nHonda Shine \nBajaj Pulsar 125 \nHero Glamour \nHero Super Splendor \nTVS Apache RTR 160\" Brand",
    "FAQ's": "Q. What Are India’s 3 Most Popular Single Disc Bikes That Are Sold The Most? \n\nA. Honda Shine, Bajaj Pulsar 125 and Hero Glamour are one of India’s highest-selling bikes equipped with single disc braking systems. \n\nQ. What Is The Use Of Disc Brakes In Motorcycles? \n\nA. Disc brake motorcycles use calipers to press pads against the disc to create friction. This action slows the rotation of the shaft, thus, reducing rotational speed of the vehicle. \n\nQ. Is A Single Disc Bike Good? \n\nA. Yes, it is much more reliable than the traditional drum brakes and has a much stronger stopping power. They are also known to be much more long lasting and justified for the price. \n\nQ. What Is The Best Type Of Disc Brake? \n\nA. Carbon ceramic discs are much more heat resistant, and are less likely to deform or warp due to heavy use, meaning they'll usually last longer. As a bonus, they're typically much lighter than their iron counterparts."

    "FAQ's": "Q. What Is An EMI? \n\nA. EMI is referred to as Equated Monthly Installments.

For repaying, the Bank allows you to pay the considerable loan amount in monthly installments, including interest. \n\nQ. What Is The Down Payment Amount? \n\nA. Down Payment is the difference between the on-road price and the amount you take on the loan. If the on-road price is Rs. 1,25,000 and you are taking Rs. 1,00,000 on finance, then Rs. 25,000 will be the down payment. \n\nQ. What Will Be The Interest Rates For The Two-Wheeler Loan? \n\nA. The interest rate of your two-wheeler loan depends on the amount remaining after the down payment. And also, it depends on the EMI tenure you have chosen. \n\nQ. What Are The Steps To Calculate EMI From BikeJunction? \n\nA.

What Are The Charges If The Bike Loan EMI Is Missed? \n\nA. The charges of missed EMI are decided by the finance company you choose. You need to pay the mandatory amount of late fee. \n\nQ. What Will Be The Tenure Of My Bike Loan? \n\nA. Bike Loan tenure depends upon the EMI duration you are taking. For example, you can avail of a 12-monthly EMI option in which you need to pay significant amounts of EMIs, but the interest rate will be lower. On the other hand, you can go for an EMI option for 84 months, in which you have to pay a low amount of EMIs at a high-interest rate. \n\nQ. What Needs To Be Done After Paying The Last EMI Of The Two-Wheeler Loan? \n\nA. Many people who take loans think that the job is done after the last EMI, but you need to complete some tasks after the repayment of your two-wheeler loans which are written below: \nGet your close loan receipt and last EMI receipt. \nGet the NOC (No Objection Certificate) or the NDC (No Due Certificate) from the Bank. \nGet the repayment certificate from the Bank. \n\nQ.
